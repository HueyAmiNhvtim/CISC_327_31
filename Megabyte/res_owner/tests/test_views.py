# something like
# We should have make food have a many-to-many relationship to restaurant man...... But that's just a QOL....

# Restaurants shenanigans
# Test if adding restaurant will make the restaurant appear in the database.
# Test if removing restaurant will delete that restaurant alongside its associating food in the database

# Food shenanigans
# Test if pressing delete will delete the actual food off the restaurant

# Test redirects too lol for every views that can redirect
# Test if template exists too lol.


# Category shenanigans
# Test to see if uncategorized food actually appear in the Others section
# Test if recategorized food actually appear in the new category
# Test if food with multiple categories will appear in both categories
# Test if deleting category will move food with only one category to go back to Others
# # Test to see if foods from other restaurants will appear in the
# # same category as other restaurants
# Test if a restaurant can use the same category for their food
